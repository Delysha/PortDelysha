                What is this project about?
            </h2>
            <p>
                This game was for a website that me and a classmate had to make in the first year. He made the website,
                 and I mainly focused on the game itself. We chose Asteroids because it looked more challenging than the other games we could make.
                 I really liked making this game since it was the first game I ever made. And it was a great first Experience

            <p class="flexP">
                In this game, I made the whole thing on my own. 
                It took me 8 weeks to get it like this and to learn how to make an Asteroids game. 
                I decided to add a few extra features, like levels, to make it look better."

                here you can see the code a little bit. i sadly cant show all of the code here but i can tell you a little bit about it.
                <br><br><br><br>
                The main mechanics include:
                <br><br><br><br>
                Spaceship Movement: You can rotate the ship with left/right arrows and accelerate with up.
                Shooting: Spacebar fires lasers.
                Lives: You’ve got 3 lives, lose one when you hit an Asteroids
                Asteroids: Randomly spawn and break into smaller pieces when destroyed.
                Difficulty: As the game progresses, more asteroids appear.
                Sound Effects: Thrust, explosion, and shooting sounds are integrated for immersion.
                It’s built using pygame with collision detection, scoring, and continuous gameplay as the core loop.
