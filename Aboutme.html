                <p>
                    Hello, I am Délysha Jannella Orsel and I’m from Amsterdam.
                    I'm a Software Developer at Media College Amsterdam.
                    At the moment, I’m working with C# in Unity Engine, but in the future, I’d love to create VR games.

                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, I want to specialize in VR/Gameplay Development.
                    I want to do this because I’d love to create VR games for children with problems in the future.
                    My goal is to focus on mental health and their well-being through my games.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I’m drawn to these types of games because they represent the future of the gaming industry.
                    I think it’s important to work with technologies that will continue to grow.
                    I believe that in about 10 years, we’ll be playing way more VR games than traditional ones on devices like laptops.
                    Plus, it’s something I find super fun and interesting to learn, which is why I want to specialize in it.
                    <br><br>
                    However, I don’t just want to make VR games; I can also create websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I personally see myself as more of an all-rounder in development, rather than strictly a game or web developer.
                    I want to do both, but as I mentioned, I mainly want to focus on VR while still being able to take on smaller tasks in other coding languages.
                    It’s important to me to keep up my skills in various languages so I don’t lose touch with them.
                    You never know, as I get older, I might want to shift my focus to different areas of development.
                    There are so many possibilities in this field, and I’m sure it’s useful to have a broad skill set rather than just focusing on one language or engine.
                    But for now, I know what I want to be first: a VR developer.
                    <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading books, watching movies, programming, and making small games in Unreal Engin 
                    <br><br>

                                So I can learn more about different aspects of the game industry.
                                Learning all these skills will definitely help me pick up other software more easily, and it opens me up to a variety of jobs instead of being limited to just one role.
                                Plus, it allows me to create more amazing projects on my own using different coding languages and game engines.

                                I'm learning VR so I can create a lot of games to help people, and because I find it really interesting.

                                I'm learning Blender so that I can learn how to create special 3D models on my own for when we do not have a artist in the team.
                                <br>
                                besides that im learning my self new things i also keep practicing my coding skills in C# so that i dont forget it and that i can upgrate my own skills in it.
