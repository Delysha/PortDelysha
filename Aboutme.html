                <p>
                    hello, I am DÃ©lysha Jannella Orsel, 18 years old, and I am from Amsterdam North.
                    I am a second-year Software Developer at Media College Amsterdam.
                    I am currently working with C# in Unity Engine, but I would like to create VR games in the future.

                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, I want to specialize in VR/Gameplay Development. 
                    I want to do this because I would love to create VR games for children with problems in the future.
                     I aim to focus my games on mental health and their well-being.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, I want to make these types of games because they represent the future of the gaming industry. 
                    I believe it is essential to work with technologies that we will continue to use in the future.
                    I am confident that in about 10 years, we will be playing many more VR games than traditional games on devices like laptops. 
                    This is also something I find very fun and interesting to learn how to create, and that's why I want to specialize in it.
                    <br><br>
                    However, I don't want to only make VR games; I can also create websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    I personally think that I am more of an all-rounder in development rather than just a game developer or a web developer.
                    I want to do both, but as I mentioned earlier, I mainly want to specialize in VR while still being able to handle smaller tasks with other coding languages. 
                    's important to me to maintain my proficiency in various coding languages so that I don't forget them.
                    You never know, as I get older, I might want to specialize in different development roles. 
                    There are so many possibilities in this field, 
                    and I am sure it is beneficial for me to have a broad skill set rather than focusing solely on one type of coding language or engine.
                    But for now, I know what I want to become first: a VR developer. 
                    <br><br>
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading books, watching movies, programming and making small games in Unreal Engine. 
                    <br><br>

                                So that I can learn more things when it comes to the game industry. 
                                Learning all these skills will inevitably help me with learning other software and it makes me more open to multiple jobs instead of being solely a programmer for one thing only.
                                Plus I can create more amazing projects on my own with different kinds of Coding languages and Game engines.
